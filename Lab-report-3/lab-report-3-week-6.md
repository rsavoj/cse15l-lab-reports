I created the config file by entering the `\.ssh` directory on my local computer. I created the config file. Then used the `vim config` command to edit the file.I pressed the `i` key to allow insertions. I coppied and pasted the code from Lab report 5. Then changed the email to the correct course specific email. After that I exited the insert mode using esc. The pressed typed `:wq`.
